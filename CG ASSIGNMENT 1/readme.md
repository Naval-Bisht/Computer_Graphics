# CG Assignment 1

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a computer graphics assignment focusing on 2D graphics rendering and simulation using WebGL.
In this assignment we are making 2D crowd simulation renderer with 2D translation, rotation, scaling/zooming of Obstacle , addding/removing a person, moving vertex and dynamic triangulation and coloring based on the population density. 

## Objectives

- Develop a WebGL-based 2D graphics application.
- Implement rendering and simulation logic.
- Provide an interactive user experience with button controls.

```

## Prerequisites

- A modern web browser supporting WebGL (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- Basic text editor or IDE for viewing/editing code.
- Install live server for easy access of code

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Naval-Bisht/Computer_Graphics.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd "CG ASSIGNMENT 1"
   ```

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a WebGL-compatible browser.
2. Interact with the application using the buttons, which trigger actions defined in `buttonHandler.js`.
3. Observe the rendering and simulation outputs managed by `render.js` and `simulation.js`.

## Running the Project

- No additional server is required; open `index.html` directly in a browser.
- Click on the live server at the bottom right section code editor(vs-code).

## File Descriptions

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the canvas and includes JavaScript/CSS files.
- `css/index.css`: Contains styling for the application interface.
- `js/buttonHandler.js`: Manages button click events and related functionality.
- `js/geometry.js`: Handles geometric data structures and calculations.
- `js/main.js`: Initializes the WebGL context and orchestrates the application.
- `js/render.js`: Implements WebGL rendering logic.
- `js/simulation.js`: Contains the simulation algorithm for dynamic updates.

## Dependencies

- WebGL (built into modern browsers).
- No external libraries required.
